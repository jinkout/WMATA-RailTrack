# ðŸš‚ WMATA-RailTrack ðŸš‚
A train tracker for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) MetroRail.

## Introduction
This program uses the [WMATA TrainPositions API](https://developer.wmata.com/api-details#api=5763fa6ff91823096cac1057&operation=5763fb35f91823096cac1058) for all location data. 

Download the regular program:
##
    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jinkout/WMATA-RailTrack/main/WMATA-Download.sh | bash

Download the color-coded program:
##
    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jinkout/WMATA-RailTrack/main/WMATA-Download-COLOR.sh | bash

## Necessary Libraries:

[__Requests:__](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) Allows Python to send HTTP/1.1 requests easily. Mandatory for functionality.
##
    pip3 install requests

[__Sty:__](https://pypi.org/project/sty/) Allows for string styling, in this case, coloring. Only needed for wmata_railtrack_PUB_Color.py
##
    pip3 install sty

## API Information:
The response elements used in this project are:
1. __CircuitId:__ The circuit identifier the train is currently on.
2. __DirectionNum:__ The direction the train is moving, irrespective of the track the train is on.
4. __TrainId:__ Uniquely identifiable internal train identifier.
5. __LineCode:__ Two-letter color abbreviation for the line.

## How to get an API key:
1. Sign up for the (WMATA Developer site)[https://developer.wmata.com/signup].
2. Open the __Products__ tab.
3. Select __Default Tier__.
4. In the search bar under *Your subscriptions*, type exactly: Train Positions
5. Agree to the terms of use and select __Subscribe__.
6. Select __Show__ on the Primary key and copy that string- this is your API key and the program will not work without it!
7. When prompted by the installer, go ahead and paste it in.

To see your API key again later, log back into the WMATA Developer site and go to the __Profile__ tab. There, all of your active API subscriptions will be shown. You can copy your key(s) again or regenerate them if you need.

## Information for Humans:
For more human-readable information on the MetroRail circuit and station system, open the Information for Humans folder.
There, you will find a PDF that contains 2 tables with information on all stations:
|StationCode|StationName|LineColor|CircuitID|SeqNum|
|---|---|---|--|---|
| The unique letter/number designation for each station | The name of the station as we know it | Line Color Abbreviation | The circuit number the train is currently on | Where that location is in sequence |

The tables are split by which direction (1 or 2) that the trains are currently traveling because the circuit ID can be different for the same station based on direction.
